**DESCRIPTION OF TASK**:

The Penetration Testing Toolkit is a Python-based, modular toolkit designed to assist security professionals in conducting penetration tests. This toolkit includes multiple modules that automate common tasks in penetration testing, such as Port Scanning and Brute Force Attacks. Each module can be run independently or integrated into a larger testing framework, allowing users to customize their penetration testing approach.

Modules Included:
Port Scanner: Identifies open ports on a target host, providing valuable information about which services are exposed.
Brute-Forcer: Tests login forms or SSH services with a wordlist to attempt to gain unauthorized access by trying multiple combinations of usernames and passwords.
Additional Modules: Future updates will include more modules such as vulnerability scanners, network sniffers, and more, making this toolkit a comprehensive penetration testing suite.
